We currently use aptana to rename pyglet internally but we could make a script that takes as an input the old fos.lib.pyglet and replaces it and renames it with the new pyglet.

We could use perl for this 
perl -pi -e s/Parameters:/Parameters/g scratch/test_propagation.py

but perhaps is better to make a nice python script.

The plus with aptana is that you can do undo!!!
